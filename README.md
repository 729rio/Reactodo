# Reactodo

## Overview

Reactodo is an interactive to-do list application built with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) and [React](https://reactjs.org/). It allows users to add, remove, and mark to-dos as done. All to-dos are stored persistently in the browser's local storage. The application features a user-friendly interface styled with custom CSS, enhancing the overall user experience.

## Features

- **Add To-Do:** Users can add new to-dos to the list.
- **Remove To-Do:** Users can remove individual to-dos from the list.
- **Mark as Done:** Users can mark to-dos as completed, visually distinguishing them from incomplete tasks.
- **Local Storage:** All to-dos are saved in the browser's local storage to persist data between sessions.
- **Responsive UI:** Styled with CSS to provide a clean and interactive user interface.
